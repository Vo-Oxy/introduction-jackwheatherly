## Review
1. What is your favorite CS topic you've learned so far?

-My favorite topic has been game development because I have an interest in games and making games.

## Exploration
2. What is the most difficult CS topic you've learned so far?

-The most difficult topic I have learned so far is also probably game development/program creation, just because it takes a long time to debug and reconfigure your code and it can take forever.
However, the end goal is worth it and rewarding.

## Challenge
3. What do you most look forward to learning this semester?

-I look forward to learning how to refine my code so it can be as efficient as possible, and to be able to have a better grasp of the various programs/IDEs we will use.
